                Though Subaru’s sales game has been unstoppable in recent years, 
                even as it keeps making fun and good things for us to drive, there’s 
                one lucrative segment it has yet to conquer—the big three-row crossover one. 
                The 2019 Subaru Ascent aims to change that, and unlike the black sheep Tribeca 
                it actually looks and feels like a Subaru.

                And I’m happy to report it handles far better than anything 
                made to haul seven or eight people really should.
